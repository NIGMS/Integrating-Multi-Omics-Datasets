For this line You could add some links to recommended tutorials
: If you are a beginner, we highly recommend to go through each module and also refer to other modules specific to RNA-seq and Bisulfite data analysis.

For the vertex AI instructions, we recommend you link to [cloud lab](https://github.com/STRIDES/NIHCloudLabGCP/blob/main/docs/vertexai.md) rather than Ben King's module.
