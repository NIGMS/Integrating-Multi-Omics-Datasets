    "DNA Methylation is an epigenetic mechanism that can control gene regulation. Methylation involves the transfer of a methyl group and typically occurs at the CpG dinucleotides in vertebrates. The locations of methylated DNA, including hyper- and hypo- methylated DNA can give information on different diseases and allow researchers to predict and study these diseases. Bisulfite sequencing is a technique that can determine the patterns of DNA methylation. Bisulfite sequencing has a single-base resolution that allows researchers to study the methylation patterns at the base level. \n",
    "\n",
    "The addition of methyl groups to DNA, mostly CpG sites, is to convert cytosine to 5-methylcytosine. DNA methylation at promoter regions can impede target gene expression. CpG sites are regions of DNA where a cytosine nucleotide occurs next to a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases along its length. \"CpG\" stands for cytosine and guanine separated by a phosphate (—C—phosphate—G—), which links the two nucleosides together in DNA. Methyl groups attached to DNA affects accessibility of genes to transcription proteins. Highly methylated DNA stays tightly wound around histones, preventing RNA polymerase binding and gene transcription. Low methylation loosens the coils and make the DNA accessible to RNA polymerase, allowing gene transcription.\n",

Both the blue and purple boxes generate a methylation coverage file, and the user can implement either of the methods to generate gene counts and feed them to perform the further downstream analysis. However, Nextflow would take a lot of storage and processing power, so it is recommended to extract the data from GEO if available. If the required data is not available from GEO, then the Nextflow pipeline can be used to extract the gene counts.

    "## **Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Understanding Epigenetics and DNA Methylation:** Learners will gain a foundational understanding of epigenetics, focusing specifically on DNA methylation as a key epigenetic mechanism.  This includes learning about CpG sites, the impact of methylation on gene expression, and the relationship between methylation patterns and disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Familiarity with DNA Methylation Analysis Techniques:** The notebook introduces bisulfite sequencing as a method for determining DNA methylation patterns.  It explains the principle behind the technique and its single-base resolution capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mastering the Methylation Analysis Workflow:** The core objective revolves around learning a complete workflow for differential methylation analysis.  This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Data Acquisition:** Understanding how to obtain methylation data, either through public databases (GEO) or by running a Nextflow pipeline (nf-core/methylseq – although this is presented as optional to reduce computational demands).\n",
    "    * **Data Preprocessing:** Performing quality control, filtering, and normalization of methylation data.  This involves using tools within the methylKit R package to filter by coverage and handle potential biases.\n",
    "    * **Differential Methylation Analysis:** Applying statistical methods (Fisher's Exact Test and Logistic Regression) to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between experimental groups.  The notebook also mentions a Betabinomial test but doesn't fully implement it.\n",
    "    * **Data Interpretation and Visualization:** Creating and interpreting visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, dendrograms, PCA plots, and volcano plots.  This allows for assessing data quality, identifying outliers, and visualizing methylation differences.\n",
    "    * **Annotation and Interpretation:** Annotating differentially methylated CpGs using the genomation package to understand their genomic context (e.g., proximity to genes, location within gene features) for biological interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Developing Practical Skills in R and Nextflow:** Learners will gain practical experience using R (specifically the methylKit and genomation packages) for data analysis.  The optional Nextflow component introduces a bioinformatics pipeline for processing raw sequencing data, enhancing the learning experience for those with more advanced bioinformatics skills and resources."

Percentage methylation histograms normally have peaks on both of the distribution's ends. Within a cell, cytosines are either methylated or unmethylated. Using this knowledge, we can determine if there is a similar pattern between many cells for locations with high methylation, low methylation, and intermediate methylation. Typically, there should be a higher number of locations with high methylation and low methylation, and a lower number of locations with intermediate methylation. Bisulfite sequencing does have a relatively high error rate and because of this, samples between 0% and 10% are typically classified as \"unmethylated\" while samples between 90% and 100% are classified as \"fully methylated\", though these thresholds are not fixed."

The Fisher's Exact Test and similar methods can be applied when there are no replicates for the test and control cases. This can allow us to make simple comparisons between the pairs of samples such as the test and control. When replicates are present, regression based methods are typically used to model the methylation levels relative to the sample groups and variation between the replicates.

    "This module provided a comprehensive overview of DNA methylation analysis, starting with an introduction to epigenetics and DNA methylation mechanisms. We explored the practical aspects of differential methylation analysis, including data acquisition from public sources or through the optional nf-core/methylseq pipeline, quality control, normalization, and statistical testing using the methylKit R package. The module emphasized data interpretation through various visualization techniques and biological annotation using the genomation package, enabling the identification of differentially methylated regions and their genomic context. By working through this notebook, learners have gained valuable skills in R and Nextflow for analyzing DNA methylation data and can now apply these techniques to explore the role of epigenetics in various biological processes and diseases."
