    "The central dogma of molecular biology is the representation of omes and omics. Omic data of various kinds are frequently employed in human medical research. The fields of omic research include the omic data produced by the central dogma, which includes the fields of genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), and metabolomics (small molecules, including amino acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, vitamins, lipids, and nucleotides); however, new types of omic data have emerged, including the fields of epigenomics (methyl tags and histones), exposomics (allergens, toxins, diet, bacteria and microorganisms). As a result, the majority of early scientific efforts were devoted to describing the genome, transcriptome, and proteome. However, seven major omics disciplines are currently being investigated in great detail: the genome (DNA), transcriptome (RNA), proteome (proteins), epigenome (DNA modifications that influence expression), metabolome (metabolites), microbiome (microbiota), and exposome (exposures).\n",

    "### <span> **Gene Expression** <span>\n",
    "The phrase \"gene expression\" refers to how a gene affects a cell's overall phenotype and functions through the activity of the molecular products that are encoded in a given nucleotide sequence of the gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing how much gene expression levels vary from the norm can help identify the genes that are genuinely crucial for things like disease prognosis or cell/tissue identity.

    "RNA sequencing has proven to be a ground breaking tool in the study of transcriptomics in the last decade. The accuracy, throughput, and the resolution produced with RNA-seq analysis has provided phenomenal results. There is a variety of applications available for transcriptomic sequencing. Currently, RNA-seq is considered to be the most effective, reliable, and flexible method to determine gene expression and transcription activation at genome-wide level.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### <span> **Differential Expression Analysis** <span>    \n",
    "Differential expression analysis is the process of statistically analyzing the normalized read count data to identify quantifiable differences in expression levels between experimental groups. A gene is said to be differentially expressed if there is a statistically significant difference or change in read counts or expression levels between two experimental conditions. Understanding the biological differences between healthy and diseased states depends on differential gene expression. With the use of this approach, researchers can choose specific gene expression targets for further investigation and pinpoint the molecular causes of phenotypic variations.\n",

The blue box represents the pipeline that can be implemented using the Nextflow nf-core/rnaseq module. The purple box represents the data that can be directly extracted from GEO. Both the blue and purple boxes generate gene counts, and the user can implement either of the methods to generate gene counts and feed them to perform the further downstream analysis. However, Nextflow would take a lot of storage and processing power, so it is recommended to extract the data from GEO if available. If the required data is not available from GEO, then the Nextflow pipeline can be used to extract the gene counts. The downstream analysis is carried through using the R kernel of a Jupyter notebook, and all the steps are discussed in detail in this module."

    "A bioinformatics pipeline called nf-core/rnaseq can be used to analyze RNA sequencing data from organisms with an annotated reference genome. This pipeline represents different stages of the analysis. It contains all the analysis steps, starting from preprocessing of the fastq data followed by genome alignment and quantification. Gene expression levels are generated from mRNA and miRNA sequencing data using RNA-Seq quantification. The next step is pseudo-alignment and quantification, followed by post-processing of the data, and then the final quality control of the input data is performed. The different colors of the pipeline represent the different methods of processing the fastq files. For example, the black line represents STAR, quantification, and salmon software usage to process the files. The user can choose any method of their choice while processing their files. \n",

First, if you are not using NIH Cloud Lab as your environment, you need to configure the Nextflow Service Account following [this guide](https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox/blob/main/docs/HowToCreateNextflowServiceAccount.md). Second, you will need to configure your config file to point to Google Batch. We provide a template that you can modify with your GCP bucket (need to create one, `gsutil mb gs://UNIQUE-BUCKET-NAME` and your project ID. Again, you only need to create the service account if not using NIH Cloud Lab.

    "This Jupyter Notebook provided a comprehensive introduction to RNA-seq analysis, guiding users through the process from raw read data to differential gene expression results.  We explored key concepts such as the central dogma, next-generation sequencing, and differential expression analysis, illustrated with clear diagrams and explanations. The notebook offered both a Nextflow pipeline for processing raw reads (optional, due to computational demands) and a streamlined approach utilizing pre-processed gene count data readily available from GEO.  Downstream analysis using R and DESeq2 enabled normalization, quality control assessment (through mean-SD plots and PCA), and the identification of differentially expressed genes, visualized via MA plots and heatmaps.  The resulting differentially expressed gene list, along with generated visualizations, provides a solid foundation for further biological interpretation and investigation.  Supplementary resources and references are provided for users seeking to delve deeper into specific aspects of RNA-seq data analysis."
