## Getting Started

### *Setting-up the Environment*

UND multi-omics repository contains three main folders representing each submodule. Every folder has its accompanying Jupyter notebook, if applicable. To start with this tutorial, you will need to set up your Amazon Web Services, Amazon SageMaker AI, and Jupyter notebook instance. 

### *Creating a notebook instance*

**1)** Follow the steps highlighted [here](https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox/blob/main/docs/HowToCreateAWSSagemakerNotebooks.md) to create a new notebook instance in Amazon SageMaker. Follow steps and be especially careful to enable idle shutdown as highlighted. For this module, in [step 4](https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox/blob/main/docs/HowToCreateAWSSagemakerNotebooks.md) in the "Notebook instance type" tab, select ml.m5.2xlarge from the dropdown box. Select conda_python3 kernel in [step 8](https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox/blob/main/docs/HowToCreateAWSSagemakerNotebooks.md).

**2)** You will need to download the tutorial files from GitHub. The easiest way to do this would be to clone the repository from NIGMS into your Amazon SageMaker notebook. To clone this repository, use the Git symbole on left menu and then insert the link `https://github.com/NIGMS/Integrating-Multi-Omics-Datasets.git` as it is illustrated in [step 7](https://github.com/NIGMS/NIGMS-Sandbox/blob/main/docs/HowToCreateAWSSagemakerNotebooks.md). Please make sure you only enter the link for the repository that you want to clone. There are other bioinformatics related learning modules available in the [NIGMS Repository](https://github.com/NIGMS). This will download our tutorial files into a folder called `DNA-Methylation-Sequencing-Analysis-with-WGBS`. Below is a screenshot of `AWS` directory of this repository when cloned in Jupyter notebook using Git.

### *Running the Modules*

The cloned repository has three folders for each submodule called RNA-Seq, RRBS, and Integration. All notebooks inside these submodules are designed to run in an R kernel. *To create a custom R kernel for each notebook, run the first cell in each notebook to initiate the R kernel creation process*. It is highly recommended to start with the RNA-Seq submodule, followed by RRBS, and finally, Integration. All the submodule folders consist of one .ipynb Jupyter notebook and accompanying files required for the analysis.

The initial cells of the notebook for RNA-Seq and RRBS submodules contain data pre-processing commands, which are done through Nextflow. Please follow other modules like [Transcriptome-Assembly-Refinement-and-Applications](https://github.com/NIGMS/Transcriptome-Assembly-Refinement-and-Applications) or [Nextflow nf-core/rnaseq](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq) for learning pre-processing through Nextflow. If Nextflow is installed correctly, the Jupyter notebook should be able to launch Nextflow and perform all the pre-processing by just running the cell and without requiring any further user input. If the command output of Nextflow is not displayed concisely, you can copy the command inside the quotes ("~/nextflow run ....") and execute it in a terminal window. Please make sure your path in the command is correct. Notebook cells with Nextflow commands will take longer to execute as they perform multiple computationally heavy tasks. RNA-seq and Bisulfite sequencing have dedicated tutorials where the analysis is explained in more detail. It is recommended to refer to those tutorials first, as this tutorial's primary focus is on integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic data. 

For RNA-Seq and Bisulfite sequencing data, further pre-processing and normalization is performed using R packages. The list of all the packages and versions is provided below under software requirements. Differential analysis, enrichment analysis, and visualization are performed in the same notebook. Further explanation of the code is provided in the markdown cells of the notebook. The Integration submodule uses the processed data results from RNA-seq and RRBS submodules to incorporate the datasets further and provide a better understanding of the experiment.

Now, you can explore the tutorial and run code blocks from each Jupyter notebook from top to bottom. If you are new to Jupyter notebooks, please follow the documentation or look for tutorials online. 

## **Workflow Diagrams**

As seen in the above figure, we have downloaded the data from the NCBI GEO website with accession number GSE173380. Sample data is already provided in the `s3://nigms-sandbox/nosi-und` Amazon S3 bucket. There is no need to download the data again unless you want to run the optional Nextflow preprocessing step on the entire dataset (which could be computationally expensive). In the second step of submodule 1 and 2, Nextflow, in collaboration with AWS Batch API and Amazon SageMaker AI, is used to perform the preprocessing. Nextflow works as a workflow manager, which enables scalable and reproducible scientific workflows using containers. AWS Batch is a service for running batch computing workloads in the AWS cloud. It enables you to define and manage compute environments, and then submit batch jobs to those environments. AWS Batch automatically provisions and scales the necessary compute resources, such as EC2 instances to execute your jobs. It can break down large workloads into smaller, independent jobs and distribute them across the available compute resources for parallel processing. Amazon SageMaker AI, on the other hand, behaves like an interface to manage and execute the process. 

After initial preprocessing using Nextflow, further preprocessing, normalization, clustering analysis, differential analysis, and visualization is done in SageMaker AI's Jupyter notebook using an R kernel. The results are written in the current working directory inside the SageMaker AI instance and transferred to cloud buckets for storage. In the fourth step, we will extract the data from step two and three to use for the multi-omics module's integration analysis. The integrative analysis is also performed using SageMaker AI's Jupyter notebook using an R kernel. We will use multi-omics integrative techniques like correlation tests, overlaps and enrichment colocalization, functional and pathway relation, and motifs search. The results from these techniques will be explored in the notebook and then transferred to cloud storage for future reference.
